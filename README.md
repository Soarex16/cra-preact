## WIP

Simple boilerplate for aliasing React with Preact X.

Based on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with some additions like a bundle analyzation.

## Available Scripts

All standard create-react-app scripts except **eject**. Seriously, you donâ€™t need it, the template has [react-app-rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
